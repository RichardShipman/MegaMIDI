# MegaMIDI
A MIDI interface utility board for projects using the Arduino Mega

Duplicates the facilities of the Sparkfun MIDI shield, but with connectors for buttons, potentiometers and MIDI connectors 
as I usually mount these things on the enclosure and wire them to the board.

Also has connectors for SD card reader and a small OLED display to plug into.
